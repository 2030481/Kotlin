/**
 *Array in Kotlin
 * Array is a collection of similar data types
 *Array is one of the most fundamental data structure in practically all programming languages. 
 *The idea behind an array is to store multiple items of the same data-type,such as an integer or string under a single variable name.
 *Arrays are used to organize data in programming so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.
